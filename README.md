# ARPG


## How to launch :
- Simply launch ch.epfl.cs107.play.Play.

- If you want to play the game progressively, go into arpg.Test before, to make sure that MODE = false, if MODE is true, then all items will be given to the player from the start of the game.

## Controls :
- Arrows = moving (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT)
- Space = use the currently equipped item
- Tab = switch item
- Q = show inventory contents 
- E = want viewInteraction

## Recommended playthrough :
- Begin by killing bombers to gain bombs
- Access the cave to collect the bow and arrow
- Make your way to the temple and collect the magic staff
- Beat the Dark Lord and enter the castle

## Differences with project guidelines :
- The hp is displayed with a bar instead of hearts.
- You can't force monsters to spawn by pressing a key, but random monsters will spawn in the Farm, the Road, the TempleRoad and the CastleRoad.
